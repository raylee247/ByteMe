                The TMMS is an independent and self-contained web-based application. The aim of this application is to match an industry mentor with a senior student and a junior student of the UBC CS Tri-Mentoring Program by using the information provided by the participants themselves. This application provides features that allow emails to be sent to a specific subset of participants and features that can generate or update a participantâ€™s report.
                <br><br>
                Mentoring programs similar to the Tri-Mentoring program exist in many different universities. It is likely that such a system already exists; however, these systems are not available to the general public, so there is no reference for the TMMS.
